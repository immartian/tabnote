# Tabnote #

Tabnote is a simple in-browser note taker for those working intensively with browser and need to record ideas, taking notes, pasting some temporary information,bookmarking some interesting links, etc. It can be triggered by a simple click, and save notes automatically to local storage (and/or to cloud).

The vision of Tabnote is not to giving you burden to manage notes, instead, it should be there waiting for your to write on and help you manage automatically. Timeline-based archive should be the key elements of this management task, but future machine-learning can help us to manage more things easily with this simple UX.
